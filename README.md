#### Analytics Engineering

In this project:

- I have build a data pipeline, which extracts data from the National Grid carbon intensity API
- I have engineered the analytical calculations to extract trends & statistics from this data as it is pulled through
- I have developed an app which allows for users to dynamically query the API via the data pipeline, allowing users to reivew the data by a date range and by network operator area + England, Scotland, Wales & GB.
